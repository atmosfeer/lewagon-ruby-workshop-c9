## Instructions:

Congratulations on reaching the first spicy assignment. From now on, the assignments will be more challenging.

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as are "C" and "G".
Write a method `complementary_dna` which takes a DNA string and returns the complement.
