## Background & Objectives

Now it's time to get familiar with the methods of the [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.3/Enumerable.html) module. The `Enumerable` module is mixed in collection data types like Array, Range and Hash. Some of these methods take a block of ruby instructions when executed. The objective of this exercise is not to understand the syntax of a ruby block, but to learn how to use these methods that are very convenient to perform operations on collection.

- **Main lesson to learn** : when you want to perform some operation on a collection (like an array), 95% of the time there is a good iterator for that! just look for the good `Enumerable#method` in the doc :)
- Understand how each iterator works, what it returns, how it applies the block to the elements of the collection.
- Take your time with this assignment and read the description inside each method. You won't be able to solve it until you understand EXACTLY what the method should do.

## Specs

- Implement each method in the code canvas `lib/enumerable.rb`. For each method, we tell you which iterator to use, because we are nice :)

## Key learning points

- What is an iterator? Which ones do you know?
- Can you choose one of them and explain exactly how it works?
