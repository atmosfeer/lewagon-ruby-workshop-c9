## Specs

Write a program that prints the lyrics of the song [99 Bottles of Beer](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html).

It will take as an argument the starting number of bottles. If the provided argument is 5, this program should work this way:

```
5 bottles of beer on the wall, 5 bottles of beer!
Take one down, pass it around, 4 bottles of beer on the wall!
4 bottles of beer on the wall, 4 bottles of beer!
Take one down, pass it around, 3 bottles of beer on the wall!
3 bottles of beer on the wall, 3 bottles of beer!
Take one down, pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall!
2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer!
Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall!
1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer!
Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall!
```

### Hint

* I hope you noticed the change from bottl**es** to bottl**e** when only 1 bottle remains !
* If you want a line break inside a string, you can use the `"\n"` character. It stands for new line.
